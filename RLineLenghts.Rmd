Jake van der Plas recently analyzed the line length used in Python packages. He was inspired by an analysis of tweet lenghts on Twitter, which observed that English tweets ...

I regularly use Python as a general purpose programming language, for purposes like image analysis, sorting of files and other tasks. In R, on the other hand, I am much more a user than a programmer, with a focus on data analysis, modeling and visualization. Jake vdPs analysis inspired me to reproduce this work in R, with the purpose to analyze line lengths in R code. From this task, I hope:

1. To become more familiar with R as a programming language and find alternatives to Python's os.walk and particularly python list comprehensions.

2. To find out whether there is a style guide for R programming, like PEP8 for the python world

3. To observe whether there are style differences w.r.t to line length between the tidyverse and base R.

3. To investigate whether the lack of a character limit leads to a line length distribution which follows a lognormal distribution.

# Counting lines in a R package

First, we need to find out how to count lines in an arbitrary R package. In python, this would be straigthforward (for me), in R, I lack foundations. 

I found out where my R library resides, and can list single packages. I then need a function which accepts a package name and  returns a list of all R files, with a nested list (or a tidy data frame) with line lengths.

Excursion: for writing functions, I will quickly learn to use testthat(). (and I will factor out this function)

```{r library.location}

```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
